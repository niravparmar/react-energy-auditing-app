    <p>These metrics are for the whole house in a pre and post-retrofit state.</p>
    <p>The 'Baseline' savings numbers will likely not be the same as the actual energy consumption of the home. These numbers are weather normalized and then projected based on the Typical Meteorological Year for the past 30 years (TMY30). In other words, this is the energy consumption of the home for a typical year, not the year that the utility bills were from. </p>
