<h3 style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold">Browser requirements:</h3>
<p>Snugg Pro is a powerful app that requires the use of these modern browsers:</p>
<p><strong>Laptop or Desktop: Google Chrome</strong>. If you don't already have it, you can <a href="http://www.google.com/chrome">get Chrome here.</a></p>
<p><strong>iPad: Default mobile Safari.</strong> (Alternative: Chrome on iPad)</p>
<p><strong>Other Tablet (Android, Windows): Google Chrome.</strong> This is often not the default browser. Just like on the laptop, you can <a href="http://www.google.com/chrome">get Chrome here.</a></p>

<h3 style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold">About your new account:</h3>
<p>
  Every Snugg Pro account comes with two free sample jobs already created:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>A reference job pre-filled with values, text and photos that you can edit</br></li>
  <li>A blank job for evaluation purposes</li>
</ol>

<p>These free jobs have a large 'Sample' watermark across all pages of the report.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Make sure you change the zip code of your sample jobs before modeling. The zip code affects modeling accuracy.</p>
