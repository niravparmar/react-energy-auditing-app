<p>Hi <%= first_name %>,</p>

<p>Thanks for signing up to Snugg Pro!</p>

<p>You can <a href="<%= app_url %>">log in here</a> with your username and password.</p>

<p>Here are some pointers to help you get started:</p>

<h3 style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold">Browser requirements:</h3>
<p>Snugg Pro is a powerful app that requires the use of these modern browsers:</p>

<p><strong>Laptop or Desktop: Google Chrome</strong>. If you don't already have it, you can <a href="http://www.google.com/chrome">get Chrome here.</a></p>
<p><strong>iPad: Default mobile Safari.</strong> (Alternative: Chrome on iPad)</p>
<p><strong>Other Tablet (Android, Windows): Google Chrome.</strong> This is often not the default browser. Just like on the laptop, you can <a href="http://www.google.com/chrome">get Chrome here.</a></p>


<h3 style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold">About your new account:</h3>
<p>
  Every Snugg Pro account comes with two free sample jobs already created:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>A reference job pre-filled with values, text and photos that you can edit</br></li>
  <li>A blank job for evaluation purposes</li>
</ol>
<p>
</p>
<p>These free jobs have a large 'Sample' watermark across all pages of the report. </p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Make sure you change the zip code of your sample jobs before modeling. The zip code affects modeling accuracy.</p>


<h3 style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold">Billing & charges:</h3>
<p>
  Weâ€™ll only ask you for your credit card when you create a billable job in Snugg Pro.<br/>
  This credit card will be charged for all billable jobs and/or subscriptions created by users of <%= company_name %>.
</p>
<p>
  Each new job is billable when it's created. Billings for single job pricing are processed each Friday for jobs created the previous 7 days.
  Monthly subscriptions are billed at the beginning of each month.  Email us for subscription pricing.
